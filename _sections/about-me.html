<p>Hey there! I’m Skepays, and I’ve been a Software Engineer for the past 16 years. I've wanted to get into game development in late 2023, and I’ve kind of stuck around since! I've started by diving into game jams in 2024 starting with the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/pirate15" target="_blank">Pirate Software Jam 15</a>, experimenting with all sorts of ideas and most importantly learning a lot.</p>

<p>I love dabbling in different genres and styles—whether it’s 2D <a href="https://skepays.itch.io/diaper-rush" target="_blank">top-down racers</a>, <a href="https://skepays.itch.io/afraid-of-kneights" target="_blank">64x64 platformers</a>, or even <a href="https://skepays.itch.io/monsters-and-mayhem" target="_blank">dice based monster battlers</a>, I’m all in! Aside from game jams, I made an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skepays.androidgamekids" target="_blank">Android game</a> to learn how Android apps are deployed and how mobile advertising works, just to keep things interesting.</p>

<p>What’s really awesome is the welcoming community in game dev. Everyone’s been super friendly, and I’m stoked to be a part of it.</p>
